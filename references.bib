   abstract = {"Organized by nutrient for easy use, Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements provides a foundation for understanding how and why the DRIs were developed, reviews the function of each nutrient in the human body, summarizes the known effects of inadequate and excessive intakes, describes how a nutrient may be related to chronic disease or developmental abnormalities, and provides the indicator of adequacy for determining nutrient requirements." "Along with dietary reference intakes of nutrients, this book presents recommendations for health maintenance and the reduction of chronic disease risk. Also included are summary tables of the DRIs, a complete practical summary of the recommendations."--Résumé de l'éditeur.},
